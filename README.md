# sample-terraform-iac-scan
Here is a sample Terraform repository leveraging a list of recommended Terraform security scan tools and GitHub Actions to implement Shift Left Security into every day activities.

> [!TIP]
> **Shift left security** is an approach to integrate security practices earlier in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), rather than treating it as a separate phase at the end. This means incorporating security considerations and activities from the initial stages of planning, design, and coding, all the way through to deployment and operation. The goal is to identify and address security vulnerabilities as early as possible, ideally during the development process, to reduce the risk of breaches and streamline the development process.
